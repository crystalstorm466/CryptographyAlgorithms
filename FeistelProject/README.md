To compile (Will work for both question 1 and 2):
Use latest version of GCC (As of writing: 14.2.1 20250110)
`gcc FeistelProject.c -o Feistel`

To run (Should be same for Windows/Mac/Linux) :
`./Feistel <input file> <output file> <Key> <block size 8|16> <e|d>`

Question 1 Code:
`gcc q1.c -o q1`
`./q1 <input file> <output file> <Key> <e|d>`

This project was so hard. 
I am writing this at 2:48 AM EST on April 16th 2025. 
I just want it to be over.
I hope I pass this class.
